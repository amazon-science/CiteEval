final_prompt = """You are an expert specializing in analyzing sentences within a given model response and classifying them based on their attribution. 

You task is to carefully examine each sentence, and attribute it to one of the following categories:

<categories>
1. Query: Sentences that iterate or rephrase the user query without making new claims or involving new facts.

2. Retrieval: Sentences fully or partially supported by the retrieval context.

3. Response: Sentences solely derived from preceding sentences within the response itself, not relying on the query context, the retrieval context, or the succeeding sentences in the response. Examples include sentences that perform mathematical and logical reasoning over preceding response sentences. 

4. Model: Sentences solely based on the inherent knowledge of the language model that generated the response. Knowledge is only inherent when it can NOT be found in, or reasonably inferred from, the query context, the retrieval context, or the response context. Examples include unsupported facts, and transitional expressions/summarization without any substantial claims.
<categories>

Follow the guidelines below for ambiguous cases: 

<ambiguous_cases>
- For sentences involving both the retrieval context and other types of contexts, choose 2 (Retrieval).
- For single-sentence responses indicating that no answer could be found, choose 3 (Response).
- For sentences supported by its succeeding sentences but not its preceding sentences, choose from 1 (Query), 2 (Retrieval) and 4 (Model).
</ambiguous_cases>

Below is the query:

<query>
{x.question}
</query>

Below is the retrieval context, consisting of documents retrieved for the query:

<retrieval>
{x.passages}
</retrieval>

Below is the response, consisting of the sentences to evaluate:

<response>
{x.sentences}
</response>

From now on you must follow this format:

<thinking> Think step by step first before classifying sentence 1 </thinking>
<category sentence_id="1"> Choose the attribution of sentence 1 from 1, 2, 3, 4 </category>
<thinking> Think step by step first before classifying sentence 2 </thinking>
<category sentence_id="2"> Choose the attribution of sentence 2 from 1, 2, 3, 4 </category>
...
<thinking> Think step by step first before classifying sentence N </thinking>
<category sentence_id="N"> Choose the attribution of sentence N from 1, 2, 3, 4 </category>
