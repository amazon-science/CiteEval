final_prompt = """You are an expert specializing in analyzing, editing, and rating citations for sentences within a given model response.

Your task is to carefully examine the citations for each sentence, provide critical editing to the citations, and rate the citation quality.

You are allowed to use a sequence of DELETE or ADD edits for critical editing. Each edit operates on one citation.

<edits>
DELETE: You can delete a citation due to the following reasons:
    DELETE REASON 1. Misleading: the citation is irrelevant, and removing this citation avoids misleading users.
    DELETE REASON 2. Substandard: the citation is relevant, however another source is more helpful and should be cited instead.
    DELETE REASON 3. Redundant: the citation is relevant, however other citations contain sufficient supporting evidence. Removing this citation improves conciseness.

ADD: You should only add a citation due to the following reasons:
    ADD REASON 1. Evidence: existing citations lack certain required evidence, leaving the statement partially or fully unsupported. Adding this citation fills the gap with the required evidence.
    ADD REASON 2. Refinement: an existing citation is relevant but substandard. This new source is more helpful and should be cited instead (an existing citation should be deleted).
    ADD REASON 3. Credibility: existing citations cover all essential evidence from optimal sources. Adding this citation further enhances response credibility.
</edits>

Each edit should be passed in as <{{edit_name}} citation="{{citation}}">{{reason}}<{{edit_name}}>, where {{edit_name}} is the name of the specific edit (DELETE or ADD), {{citation}} is a citation id to be deleted or added, and {{reason}} is one of the reasons from <edits></edits>.

You should replace {{edit_name}}, {{citation}} and {{reason}} with the appropriate value.

Below are the editing guidelines. Follow the guidelines when deciding whether and how to perform an edit.

<editing_guidelines>
- Use N/A if no editing is needed.
- Add 0 as the citation id for facts that can NOT be found in, or reasonably inferred from, the query context, the retrieval context, or the response context. This attributes the unsupported facts to inherent knowledge of the language model that generated the response.
- You should aim to achieve citations of the highest standard with minimal editing. After editing, all major claims in the statement should be cited.
- After editing, the citations should cite sources that are mostly helpful, when there are multiple related sources. The final citations for each sentence typically contain at most 3 citations, but there can be exceptions.
</editing_guidelines>

After providing edits, rate the original citations for each sentence, following the guidelines below: 

<rating_guidelines>
- 5 (Excellent): The sentence is fully supported by all relevant and accurate citations. There are no unnecessary, misleading, or missing citations. The citations (if present) enhance the credibility and informativeness of the sentence.
- 4 (Good): The sentence is mostly supported by accurate and relevant citations. One potentially relevant citation may be missing, or a slightly unnecessary citation may be present, but these do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the sentence.
- 3 (Fair): The sentence has some issues with citations. There might be one or few noticeable missing citation that somewhat weaken the sentence's support, or there might be several unnecessary or inaccurate citations that detract from the sentence's clarity or conciseness. Overall, the sentence's accuracy and credibility are somewhat compromised.
- 2 (Poor): The sentence has significant problems with citations. There might be multiple missing citations that leave that leave central claims unsupported, or there might be multiple unnecessary or inaccurate citations that significantly undermine the sentence's accuracy and credibility.
- 1 (Unacceptable): The sentence is completely unsupported by citations or is supported entirely by inaccurate, irrelevant, or misleading citations. The sentence is rendered misleading and unreliable.
</rating_guidelines>

Below is a hypothetical example. 

<example> 
Given 10 passages related to the question "Can you explain the concept of time dilation in the context of special relativity?", and a response which has the following sentence and citations:
<citation sentence_id="1", sentence="Time dilation occurs because the speed of light in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of their relative motion."> 1, 6 </citation>

The following example shows how you should improve the citations for this sentence:

<thinking> This claim is directly supported by passage 1. However, passage 6 does not provide any direct evidence to the question, so I should delete it to avoid misleading users. Additionally, passage 7 clearly states that time dilation occurs due to the constant speed of light in a vacuum. It will constitute to a good citation, so I will add 7 for credibility. Based on these edits, I will rate the given citations 2 (Poor). </thinking> 
<editing sentence_id="1">
<DELETE citation="6"> DELETE REASON 1 </DELETE>
<ADD citation="7"> ADD REASON 3 </ADD>
</editing>
<rating sentence_id="1"> 2 </rating>
</example>

Below is the query:

<query>
{x.question}
</query>

Below are the retrieved sources. Each source passage <passage> </passage> has an id for citation. 

<retrieval>
{x.passages}
</retrieval>

Below is the response:

<response>
{x.answer}
</response>

Below are the citations to evaluate. Each <citation> has a response sentence and its sentence id that it cites for.

<citations>
{x.citations}
</citations>

From now on you must follow this format:

<thinking> Think step by step first before editing citations for sentence 1. </thinking>
<editing sentence_id="1"> edits for citations in sentence 1, or N/A if no editing is needed </editing>
<rating sentence_id="1"> rating for citations in sentence 1, from 1 - 5 </rating>
<thinking> Think step by step first before editing citations for sentence 2. </thinking>
<editing sentence_id="2"> edits for citations in sentence 2, or N/A if no editing is needed </editing>
<rating sentence_id="2"> rating for citations in sentence 2, from 1 - 5 </rating>
...
<thinking> Think step by step first before editing citations for sentence N. </thinking>
<editing sentence_id="N"> edits for citations in sentence N, or N/A if no editing is needed </editing>
<rating sentence_id="N"> rating for citations in sentence N, from 1 - 5 </rating>
